          <h1>Keith E. Dixon Proffesional Music Producer, Artist Manager and Sales & Marketing Specialist</h1>


          <P><em>Keith E. Dixon Music Industry Executive and founder of <em><strong><a href="https://bridgebuildersentertainment.com/">Bridge Builders Entertainment</a></strong></em> artist tour management company and <em> <strong><a
                    href="https://revenuesafemarketingsolutions.wordpress.com/">Revenue Safe Marekting Solutions</a></strong></em> which increases company
              revenue for other businesses through paid advertisement, grew up on Chicago's Westside. Introduced to music by his father Lawrence (Gospel Singer) as a small child, Keith began producing music at the age of 15 and formed 1/3 of rap
              group
              BLAK HUSLAS. Inspite of gaining
              noteriety in the city as a premiere talent selling thousands of CDs in store and from the trunk, Keith found himself in a bit of a "plot-twist" when the production from one of BLAK HUSLAS more popular singles was sold by his former
              independent lable to later become "Cross-Roads by Bone Thugs N Harmony." Needless to say, while a fan, this prompted Keith to take a deeper dive into learning the ins and ousts of the music business. Through personal research and work
              experience with major record labels he has gained full perspective of how to secure matters in the best interst of an artist.
